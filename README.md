# OSS_final

The goal of the project was to create a program that implements multiple games so that users can quickly switch to other games if they are bored playing one game.

I ran into various problems and decided to proceed with only one game.

This game was embodied in C language in Tetris.

Target User: Everyone who loves the game.

#Problem : a bug appeared with infinite screen output.
